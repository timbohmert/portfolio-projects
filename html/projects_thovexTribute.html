        <h3>the beginnings</h3>
        <p>Candide was born on 22 May 1982 in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of France. He first strapped on a pair of skis at the age of 2.5. Candide joined the local ski club when he was 5, and he found a passion in mogul skiing. At the age of 14, he won his first French National Junior Championships in the mogul division.  Yet, even at a young age, he had a desire to innovate and looked to freestyle snowboarding for inspiration.</p>

        <h3>the rise</h3>
        <p>Candide signed with Quiksilver in 1997, his firt professional sponsorship contract. It was Candide's second trip Chad's Gap that he gained noteriety within the ski community, where he landed a D-spin 720 over the massive gap. Candide continued to impress in competitions and events. He won his first gold medal at the X-Games Big Air division in 2000. After winning his first, Candide went on to win two more X-Game gold medals, one in Superpipe and one in Slopestyle. In 2007, however, Candide looked to push the limits of what is humanly possible on skis in creating "The Big Bertha", but came up short and fractured his L1 vertebrae. This injury ended his season and put his skiing career in jeopardy.</p>

        <h3>the legend</h3>
        <p>In 2008, not unlike a phoenix, Candide rose from this injury with a renewed energy, which he then directed towards powder terrain that was far from the crowds and competitions. Candide also took this opportunity to produce "The Candide Invitational Story" documentary and the "Candide Kamera" film, which captured his riding adventures with Simon Favier. After a couple of years away from competition, Candide's new focus on big mountaiun and back country skiing found him invited to the Red Bull Line Catcher in 2010. After capturing the gold medal in this competition, Candide found his competitive groove again and went on to win the Freeride World Tour that same year. His fascination for film making brought his path away from competitions once again. When people now think of Candide, it is his productions, such as Few Words, Full Throttle, and the One of Those Days series, that have cemented him into mythical status. The impact that Candide Thovex will have upon skiing is far greater than the tracks that are left in the powder.</p>

                <p id="fresh-tim">In Lakeville, Minnesota,born and raised. <br>Dreaming of medical school is how I spent most of my days. <br>Studying the MCAT, taxing it out, not cool. <br>And working in healthcare outside of school. <br>When a couple of my guys thought it would be good, <br>started making a finance app best we could. <br>I got one little taste and for coding I cared. <br>And said "I'm moving with a career in development of software."</p>

                <p>About two years ago, two of my colleagues and myself started ideating around a stock market competition game. In the development of our app, Socap, I became intrigued with building the user experience and user interface. Once I got to a level of making the GUI on Adobe XD, I became increasingly curious about the machine that would create functionality in such an app. This became the impetus for a growing interest in computer science. it was then in September 2019 that I decided to change course from pursuing medical school and go all in on learning programming. </p>
